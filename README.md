***THIS PROJECT IS OBSOLETE. PLEASE USE https://github.com/imagej/ImageJ***

ImageJA was a project providing a clean Git history of the ImageJ project, with
a proper `pom.xml` file so that it could be used with Maven without hassles.

Releases of ImageJ up to 1.53j were published to Maven repositories via
ImageJA, and those tags are
[archived here](https://github.com/imagej/ImageJA/tags).
But starting with ImageJ 1.53k, releases are now built and deployed directly
from the
[primary ImageJ repository on GitHub](https://github.com/imagej/ImageJ).
